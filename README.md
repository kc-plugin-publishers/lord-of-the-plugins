See also https://github.com/kc-plugin-publishers/kc-plugins-master-list. There are .plugininfo files which describe installable plugins.

Change the .ini file if you want to. Even if you don't want to change it, check there which plugin will be installed and where.

Run with python 2. Check the result - the plugin given in the .ini file should now be installed to the given directory.
